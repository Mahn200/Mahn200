I approach **cybersecurity** with a calm, analytical mindset.  
My focus is on understanding how systems behave, where they become fragile,  
and how they can be strengthened through thoughtful design and testing.

I enjoy moving between **security analysis**, **software development**,  
and careful experimentation with modern tools.
